# Basketball Game Scheduler

An automated, email-based basketball game scheduler built on AWS serverless infrastructure. Every Monday it emails ~100 players about the upcoming Saturday game, processes replies using natural language understanding (AWS Bedrock + Claude), and manages RSVPs, reminders, and cancellations — all through email.

## How It Works

1. **Monday 9AM** — An announcement email is sent to all active players for Saturday's game (skipped if an admin pre-cancelled it)
2. **Players reply** in natural language — "I'm in", "Can't make it", "I'll bring 2 friends", "Who's playing?"
3. **The system understands** the intent via Claude (Bedrock) and updates the roster accordingly
4. **Wed & Fri 9AM** — If fewer than 6 players have confirmed, reminders are sent. If still under 6 by Friday, the game is cancelled
5. **Friday with 6+** — Confirmation emails go out with the final roster
6. **Saturday 1PM UTC** — The game is marked as PLAYED in DynamoDB
7. **Admins** can email `admin@<domain>` at any time to cancel a game, add players, or deactivate/reactivate players

## Architecture

![Component Architecture](docs/diagrams/01_component_architecture.png)

![Game Finalisation Flow](docs/diagrams/05_game_finalizer_flow.png)

Fully serverless on AWS (eu-west-1):

| Service | Role |
|---|---|
| **EventBridge** | Cron schedules (Mon, Wed, Fri, Sat) |
| **Lambda** (×5) | announcement-sender, email-processor, reminder-checker, game-finalizer, admin-processor |
| **SES** | Send and receive emails |
| **S3** | Store raw inbound emails (prefix-routed: `inbound/` → players, `admin/` → admin) |
| **DynamoDB** (×2 tables) | Players + Games (including RSVPs) |
| **Bedrock** (Claude Haiku) | Parse player intent and admin commands from free-text emails |
| **Route 53** | Domain DNS + MX records for SES inbound |

Estimated monthly cost: **~$1.40–1.80**

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for detailed flow diagrams, data model, and access patterns.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12**
- **Docker** (for integration tests)
- **Terraform** (for infrastructure provisioning)
- **AWS account** (eu-west-1 region)
- **Registered domain** — required for SES inbound email (e.g. a cheap `.link` or `.xyz` via Route 53)

### AWS Setup (one-time manual steps)

1. **Register a domain** via Route 53 (or transfer an existing one)
2. **Exit SES sandbox** — submit a support request in the AWS console to enable sending to unverified email addresses
3. **Enable Bedrock model access** — enable Claude Haiku 3 in the Bedrock console for eu-west-1

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
make install
```

### 2. Run tests

```bash
# Unit tests (no Docker needed)
make test-unit

# Integration tests (requires Docker)
make test-integration

# All tests
make test-all
```

### 3. Deploy infrastructure

```bash
make tf-init
make tf-plan    # review changes
make tf-apply   # deploy
```

Terraform will prompt for required variables, or create a `terraform.tfvars` file:

```hcl
domain_name    = "yourdomain.com"
sender_email   = "scheduler@yourdomain.com"
admin_email    = "admin@yourdomain.com"
game_time      = "10:00 AM"
game_location  = "Community Center Court"
```

### 4. Import players

Prepare a CSV with `email,name` columns (name is optional):

```csv
email,name
john@example.com,John
jane@example.com,Jane
player3@example.com,
```

Import into DynamoDB:

```bash
python scripts/import_players.py \
    --csv-file your_players.csv \
    --table-name Players \
    --region eu-west-1
```

### 5. Update Route 53 nameservers

After `terraform apply`, update your domain registrar's nameservers to the ones output by Terraform. This enables SES to receive inbound emails.

## Configuration

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `domain_name` | Domain for SES email | *(required)* |
| `sender_email` | From address for outgoing emails | *(required)* |
| `admin_email` | Admin command inbox (`admin@<domain>`) | *(required)* |
| `game_time` | Game time shown in announcements | `10:00 AM` |
| `game_location` | Game location shown in announcements | `TBD` |
| `bedrock_model_id` | Bedrock model for NLU | `anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0` |
| `min_players` | Minimum players for a game to proceed | `6` |
| `environment` | Environment tag | `prod` |

## Supported Player Intents

Players reply to emails in natural language. The system understands:

| What the player says | What happens |
|---|---|
| "I'm in" / "Count me in" | Marked as confirmed |
| "Can't make it" / "I'm out" | Marked as declined |
| "Maybe" / "Not sure yet" | Marked as maybe |
| "I'll bring 2 friends, Mike and Sarah" | Confirmed with 2 guests |
| "Who's playing?" | Receives current roster |
| "Is John coming?" | Receives that player's status |

## Admin Commands

Admins email `admin@<domain>` in natural language. Admin status is stored in DynamoDB (not config) so admins can be added at runtime without redeployment.

| What the admin says | What happens |
|---|---|
| "Cancel the game on 2026-04-19" (before announcement) | Game pre-cancelled; Monday sends "no game this week" email |
| "Cancel the game on 2026-04-19" (after announcement) | Game cancelled; YES/MAYBE players notified immediately |
| "Add player alice@example.com, name Alice" | Alice added as an active player |
| "Add admin bob@example.com, name Bob" | Bob added as an active admin |
| "Deactivate charlie@example.com" | Charlie deactivated; no longer receives game emails |
| "Reactivate charlie@example.com" | Charlie reactivated |

Non-admins who email the admin address receive a rejection email.

## Data Model

Two DynamoDB tables with no GSIs:

**Players** — `PK: email, SK: active`

**Games** — `PK: gameDate (YYYY-MM-DD), SK: gameStatus | playerStatus#YES | playerStatus#NO | playerStatus#MAYBE`

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for full schema and access patterns.
